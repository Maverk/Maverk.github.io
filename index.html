<h1>What is the Noiseless Space</h1>
<p>This project is a reflection of the sounds we all ignore every day. We grow accustom to any stimulation over time, from touch to taste to sound. And this is even more so with all the ways we can be distracted. I made this with the thought of seeing what you didn't hear, so you can enjoy silence a bit more.This project is a reflection of the sounds we all ignore every day.
